I was involved in the development of a Shop Management System as a personal project, aiming to showcase my proficiency in various technologies. 
The project centered around utilizing Flask for building the web application's backend, Docker for containerization, and Ethereum blockchain for implementing smart contracts.
I also integrated PySpark for data analysis and processing. Notably, MySQL Server was employed to manage the project's database.
Through this project, I demonstrated practical skills in web development, containerization, blockchain technology, data manipulation and database administration.
